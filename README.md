# DateTime.Now Banisher
Disables the use of DateTime.Now, in favour of DateTime.UtcNow in C# projects  
This can be installed as either a visual studio extension or a nuget package as an analyzer.  
I have only published the nuget package, however, the extension can be easily built with the source.
